This is the "root" for all Math related notes. Its children will either be the names of books that I am studying, or the names of the subject the notes relate to. I expect this to mainly be notes for books until a bit later when the notes become more generalized. I will then start pooling the notes from the book related notes into the more general note sections. An example would be that my notes for the book *Concrete Mathematics*  will be filtered into a note section for *discrete math*.
