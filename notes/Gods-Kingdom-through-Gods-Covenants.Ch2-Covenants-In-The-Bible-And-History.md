## Types Of Covenants In The Bible
The Hebrew word for covenant is בְּרִית (berit) and is used for different types of oath-bound commitments. In the OT:
- International treaties (Josh. 9:6; 1 Kings 15:19)
- Clan Alliances (Gen. 14:13)
- Personal Agreements (Gen. 31:44)
- National Agreements (Jer. 34:8-10)
- Loyalty Agreements (1 Sam. 20:14-17)
- Marriage (Mal. 2:14)

## What is a Covenant in the Ancient Near East? 
Daniel C. Lane's definition: *A covenant is an enduring agreement which defines a relationship between two parties involving a solemn, binding obligation(s) specified on the part of at least one of  the parties toward the other, made by oath under threat of divine curse, and ratified by a visual ritual.*

Covenants and treaties similar to those found in the Old Testament were common in hte ancient Near East (Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey). There are two types of these treaties which are noteworthy.
1. The suzerain-vassal treaty
    - A diplomatic treaty between a great king (the suzerain) and the client kings (vassals). This covenant reinforces the interests of the suzerain by arguments from history and affirmations of loyalty on the part of the vassals with divine sanctions.
2. the royal charter or land grant
    - This treaty involves a grant of property or a privileged position (priest or royal office) given as a favor by a god or kin. Honor and interpersonal relationship was the focus of these treaties.

Deuteronomy is identical in form (but not in content) to the suzerain-vassal treaties of the Hittites from the late fourteenth century B.C. 

It should be noted that scholars are unsure what to make of these two covenant types. Specifically weather or not the differences really matter to the biblical narrative (does covenant format 1 really mean something different from format 2 in scripture).

## Major Covenants In The Bible

This list is not agreed on by everyone, but I really like it : )

## Covenants As the Framework of the Biblical Metanarrative
God created everything, and specifically created Mankind to rule under Him. Man gets his purpose from his relationship and standing before his Creator. The first Man and Woman rejected this design, and without God at the center of the universe we try to fit the role. I want to be the center as much as anyone else and the rest is history. Chaos has reigned since the fall and we are no longer in a right relationship with God. All of Mankind is judged and God starts anew with Noah, and man again fails. God uses Abraham and his family as a fresh start at this again. Israel would be an example of how man aught to live before God, an example of what a nation with a proper relationship to God looks like. The Israelites are here blessed for their obedience and specifically cursed for their disobedience. Israel, like those before them, failed to keep their end of the covenant. This is why the prophets talk about a covenant that cannot be broken, a covenant where all will know God: the New Covenant.
- this is a really clean description of the narrative of scripture. 

## Covenant vs Contract
- Contracts generally present benefits that each party expects. They are thing oriented, with one party agreeing to provide a specific quantity to the other party. A mutually satisfactory agreement is important. They are also finite, and expect fulfillment of terms.
- Covenants arise from a desire for intimacy, and they are people oriented. There is no negotiation, the greater member offers his help to the lesser member. A 'gift' is to Covenants as 'negotiation' is to Contracts. The obligation of a covenant is loyalty, and these are usually forever. Like a contract, a covenant can be broken, but  the point in which this transpires is less clear since it breaks based on a quality of intimacy.

## Words Words Words
Two words used to express the relationship between paries in covenant. Neither translate perfectly into English.
1. hesed
    - Related to showing kindness in loyal love.
2. emet
    - Can be translated as either "faithfulness" or "truth". 
    
They cannot be translated perfectly by reducing the word pair to the sum of its parts (odds and ends does not mean the combination of the word "odds" and the word "ends").

## Examples Of Covenant Relationships In Scripture 
[Genesis 47:29-30] When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his sone Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness (hesed and emet). Do not bury me in Egypt, [30] but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried." "I will do as you say," he said. (NIV)

- The stronger party member, Joseph is obligated to help the weaker party, Jacob. The fulfillment of this obligation is referred to as showing hesed and emet.

[1 Kings 8:23] "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart" (ESV)

[Psalm 117] Praise the LORD, all nations! Extol him, all peoples! For great is his steadfast love [hesed] toward us, and the faithfulness [emet] of the LORD endures forever. Praise the LORD! (ESV)
- This is the shortest hymn in the Psalms.
- Given the format of a hymn, verse 1 is the Call to Praise and verse 2 is the Reason for Praise. The reason for boasting about the Lord is his faithful, loyal love in his covenant with his people Israel.
