## Covenant as the Framework
When we think of covenants in scripture, we see them not as the central point of scripture, but as the organizational structure of the Bible. This covenantal structure, when understood properly, allows us to handle scripture precisely and effectively. Virtually all varieties of Christian Theology acknowledge some form of covenantal structure to the biblical narrative, and a great deal of Christian/Pseudo-Christian conflicts can be summarized as a failure to understand the structure of scripture. The Federal Vision, Hyper Dispensationalism, and the conflicts with the Judaizers recorded in scripture are all examples of covenantal issues. 


## What is "Progressive Covenantalism?"
- **Progressive**: God's plan unfolds from the old to the new. There is only one plan of redemption which is progressively revealed through scripture
- **Covenantal**: The plan of redemption finds its unity, and unfolds through the framework of the biblical covenants. This terminates in Christ and the New Covenant. 

Each covenant has its role in God's redemptive plan, and in order to properly understand this role we need to understand each covenant int its own redemptive-historical context. This is done by understanding the covenants which are chronologically adjacent to the covenant in focus. Also, as Christians we understand that every covenant is fulfilled in Christ Jesus, and we can only properly apply the understanding of these covenants to ourselves by seeing how they find their fulfillment in Him. 

## Biblical Theology - Systematic Theology 
"Any attempt to understand the progressive nature of the biblical covenants is an exercise in 'biblical theology'. It is also the first step in drawing legitimate theological conclusions from Scripture and thus applying the 'whole counsel of God' to our lives, which is the task of 'systematic theology'."
- **Biblical Theology**
    1. From a high level, any form of thinking through the scriptures to "put them together" is biblical theology. The focus is on seeing how books and covenants connect to each other, especially in the light of Christ.
    2. Biblical theology from an Enlightenment perspective was the study of the Bible as any other book and with the presupposition of Naturalism. Scripture was not allowed to be read on its own terms, as the inspired word of God, and was essentially assumed to have little to no connectivity. Diversity is emphasized and "biblical theology" was more of a descriptive term.
    3. Geerhardus Vos, Abraham Kuyper, and Herman Bavinck are examples of theologians who came out of the Enlightenment and pioneered an Evangelical biblical theology.
    4. **Definition 1**: as per Brian Rosner, Biblical theology is "theological interpretation of Scripture in and for the church. It proceeds with historical and literary  sensitivity and seeks to analyze and synthesize the Bible's teaching about God and His relations to the world on its own terms, maintaining sight of the Bible's overarching narrative and Christocentric focus."
    5. **Definition 2**: the hermeneutical discipline that seeks to do justice to what Scripture claims to be and what it actually is.

- **Systematic Theology**
    1. **Definition**: As per John Frame, "the application of God's Word by persons to all areas of life."
    2. Systematic theology goes further than biblical theology in theological construction, the formulation of doctrine, and the application of scripture to everything in life.
    3. Systematic theology generates a worldview by properly handling the scriptures and applying it to all aspects of life, thanks to true biblical theology.
    4. Apologetic in nature outside of the Church. 

Biblical theology is needed before systematic theology, because we cannot apply Scripture to our life if we have faulty hermeneutics. Systematic theology allows us to bring our entire thought captive to Christ, while biblical theology is rightly dividing God's Word.

## The Hermeneutical Views of GKtGC
"In order to be *biblical* in our theology, our interpretation and application of Scripture must (1) take seriously what Scripture claims to be; and (2) interpret Scripture in the light of what it actually is as God's unfolding revelation across time."
1. What Scripture claims to be
    - If we take seriously the claims of Scripture, that it is the inspired Word's of God, then we will expect an overall unity and coherence between every book of the bible. In spite of the diversity between the books, and the time span, we expect that God's unfailing plan and purposes are taught, documented, and completed in history and in Scripture. "Scripture must interpret Scripture"
    - The New Testament's interpretation of the Old is primary. It is reasonable to believe that the Old Testament authors did not know the full magnitude of their writings when they wrote it. Newer text do not contradict or correct older, and the original authors understanding of how God interacts with His people is never changed or proven wrong. Later parts draw out and explain more clearly the earlier parts.
    - Historical-Grammatical exegesis with a canonical reading.

2. What Scripture actually is
    - Scripture is a **word-act revelation**, meaning that Scripture is God's own authoritative interpretation of his redemptive acts through the agency of human authors. All of God's actions are revelatory of him, the actions are followed with words and interpretations of these acts, and the Scriptures are a product of the actions of God. At a canonical scale, this is shown in how the New Testament provides the final say on the Old.
    - Scripture is a **progressive revelation**, meaning that it is revealed through time and works through time and space. Heb 1:1-3 "Long ago God spoke to our fathers by the prophets at many times and in many ways" (paraphrase). Revelation occurs in history and points to something beyond itself to something greater, namely Christ.

We read the scriptures from three perspectives, textual, epochal, and canonical.
- **Textual**: The immediate context of scripture. We understand the text in its immediate context, its literary type, its grammar, the structure of its text, etc.
- **Epochal**: THe context in relation of where the text is in redemptive history. What comes before and after it. This does not mean that there are multiple plans, but that revelation is progressive. While there is debate on how prolific this is, this is best seen in the Old-to-New Testament change. This can be summarized comfortably by following the biblical covenants. The Judaizers failed to understand this and viewed the OT as an ends in itself. Scripture was interpreted in light of Sinai.
- **Canonical**: The overall perspective. Given that God's Word is a unified revelation, the texts must be understood in its relationship to the entire Canon. When we read Scripture from this context we can read Scripture in its fullest context.

A **theological** reading which can be described as a **grammatical/literary-historical-canonical** reading of Scripture. Promise-Fulfillment motif in Scripture is an example of this all being brought together.

## Typology
Typology is different from allegory because, with typology, its patterns are grounded in history, the text, and intertextual development. Persons, events, and institutions are intended by God to correspond to each other. Allegory assumes none of this. Allegorical interpretation requires an extratextual grid for its "this means that" relations.

The six New Testament typological texts are (Rom. 5:14; 1 Cor. 10:6, 11; Heb. 8:5; 9:24; 1 Pet. 3:21)

- **Definition of Typology Used**: The study of Old Testament salvation-historical realities or "types" which God has specifically designed to correspond to, and predictively prefigure, their intensified antitypical fulfillment aspects (inaugurated and consummated) in New Testament salvation history.
    1. Typology is rooted in historical and textual realities. It is founded on the organic connection of God's promises with his fulfillment of those promises, linking the past to the future and retroactively linking the future to the past.
    2. Typology is prophetic and predictive and is divinely given and intended. This is more of an indirect prophesy which becomes clearer as these God given patterns work their way out through redemptive history, corresponding to Paul's mystery (Eph. 1:9-10; 3:1-10). 

Typology is how we can reconcile the tension in the statements that the Gospel was revealed clearly through the prophets in the past, while also saying the Gospel was hidden and not fully known until the coming of Christ (Rom. 3:21 vs Rom 16:25-27). This view of typology requires a very high view of divine providence and knowledge, and it can be understood as a type of predictive prophesy. 

- **Typology - Promise-Fulfillment**: The types are divinely instituted and revealed to us as history moves on. Typology is revealed in a pattern of "promise-fulfillment" which can be quickly seen in Adam. Adam is a type who is followed by "other Adams" (Noah, Abraham, Israel, David) with these Adams concluding and finding their ultimate fulfillment in Christ Jesus.
- **Typology - Fortiori (lesser to greater)**: Typology has the quality of escalation as the type is fulfilled in the antitype. The antitype (Christ Jesus) is always greater than the previous types. This escalation is not incremental, and this escalation only occurs fully with the coming of Christ (Rom. 5:14). Given the Adam example, the other Adams after the first still fail in their obedience and it is only completed in Christ's perfect obedience. All of the Davidic Kings fail in their obedience asides from David's greater Son, Christ. The lesser to greater relationship of typology is the basis for the real discontinuity seen in scripture. When the antitype is arrives in history the type meets its *telos* or terminus, and the entire era introduces initials massive changes. This is why the New Testament is entirely focused on Christ, the parts have found their end and purpose in the whole.

**All types find their fulfillment in Christ before they have application to us**

- **Example Types**
    1. Christ is the true Son, the true Israel, the true servant, the true vine.
        - Isa. 5:1-7 and Hos. 11:1
        - used in Matt. 2:15 and John 15:1-17
        - We as God's people participate in this typological pattern only by virtue of our relationship in Christ. The church is not the antitypical fulfillment of Israel in the first sense, Christ is.
        - Through our union to Christ his work becomes ours as his new covenant people


## My Thoughts
These are the most concise, clear, biblical, and Christ honoring definitions of Biblical theology, Systematic theology, and typology I have ever seen. The hermeneutic layed out is also very clear and reasonable. Dr. Gentry and Dr. Wellum come across as men who care greatly about teaching Christ's sheep which is making this study very enjoyable.
